# Phase-3-Active-Record-Code-Challenge-Product-Review

## Description

For this assignment, we'll be working with an e-commerce domain. We'll be focusing on the product reviews.
We have three models: User, Review, and Product.
For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Productsâ€™ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.
Product - User is a many to many relationship.
